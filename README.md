## UKHSA Statistics Production Hub

This repository has been created by the Statistics Production Division in the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). It is used to host a number of guidance materials and other resources relating to the production and dissemination of statistics. 

We have decided to open source these materials to better enable sharing across government (and beyond), and to invite others to share their insights with us. 

If you would like to contribute to this repository or make suggestions for additions or improvement, please see our [contributing instructions](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
